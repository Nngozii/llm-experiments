# LLM Engineering Practice

This repository contains my hands-on practice, experiments, and mini-projects while taking the **AI Engineer Core Track: LLM Engineering, RAG, QLoRA, Agents** course by Edward Donner.

The work here is inspired by structured coursework, personal exploration, and independent experimentation — with the goal of building practical intuition around real-world AI applications.

## What You'll Find Here

* Prompt engineering experiments
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) practice
* LLM API integrations
* Small AI utilities and demos
* Notes and exploratory notebooks

## Tech Stack

* Python
* LLM APIs (OpenAI / Ollama / Gemini)
* Vector databases (when applicable)
* FastAPI / backend integrations
* Jupyter notebooks for experimentation

## Purpose

This repo is mainly for:

* Learning by building
* Documenting progress 
* Developing practical AI engineering skills

## Status

Actively growing as I learn and experiment more.

## Disclaimer

This is a learning-focused repository — expect experimentation, iteration, and occasional rough edges.
